# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project hasn't gone through proper security testing, so using it in production is highly discuraged. Thus security issues can be reported in the [public issue tracker of the project](https://github.com/markszabo/PostQ/issues/new) to enable others to jump in and fix them, and to also provide a learning opportunity for everyone. If you would prefer to disclose an issue privately, you can send it directly to me at [mark@szabo-simon.hu](mailto:mark@szabo-simon.hu).
